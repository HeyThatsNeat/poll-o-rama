# **Poll-O-Rama**
![Poll-O-Rama preview](/public/pictures/Poll-o-rama-Readme-picture.png)
Welcome to Poll-O-Rama, a poll taking and creating website created by a learning developer with a passion for polls! This project was born out of a fascination for polls that began in high school and has now grown into a fully-functional website where users can create, edit, and delete their own polls. As a user-based platform, you can browse and participate in polls created by other users. Additionally, you get your very own "Pollfile" page, a.k.a. your profile page, where you can manage your own polls. On the main "Poll Page," you can see how many people have participated in each poll, adding an exciting element of community engagement. Thank you for joining me on this journey to make polling more fun and accessible for everyone! I hope you enjoy using Poll-O-Rama as much as I enjoyed creating it.
