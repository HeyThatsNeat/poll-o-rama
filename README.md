# **Poll-O-Rama**
![Poll-O-Rama preview](/public/pictures/Poll-o-rama-Readme-picture.png)
Poll-O-Rama is a poll taking and creating website inspired by my odd fascination of polls. Polls were something simple to pass the time when I was in highschool, so hopefully you'll find as much enjoyment taking polls as I did growing up! This website is entirely user based, so any polls you see were made by another user. You also get your very own "Pollfile" page where you can create, edit, and delete your freshly made polls. Once you answer a poll on the main "Poll Page", you will see how many people have answered the poll as well.
